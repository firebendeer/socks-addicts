What is SocksAddicts?
    SocksAddicts is a business venture offering colorful handmade Tie-Dye Nike socks. These socks are an essential accessory for whoever feels like it. Handcrafted in the Netherlands, these socks can be shipped to you only in Europe (for now...)

What products are offered?
    For now, the expected gamma of offered products can be classified into three product categories namely TieDye, Marble and Reverse TieDye. 

    For TieDye, you can expect a painted white sock a la TieDye (normal technique).

    For Marble, you can expect a white pair of socks that was painted using the Marble technique.

    Last but not least, Reverse TieDye is a product of bleached black socks that gives it a brown nuance.
